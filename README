The Urban Image Photo Library Module
===========================================

The purpose of this library is to provide easy access to the user's photo library.
Not only will it return the photos, but it will also return useful information about 
the photo.  This library will return the following pieces of information about a photo:

1. The full resolution of the image
2. A thumbnail of the image
3. The type of file (image or video)
4. Location information including:
	a. latitude
	b. longitude
	c. altitude
	d. course
	e. horizontal accuracy
	f. vertical accuracy
	g. speed
	h. timestamp
5. If the file is a video it will return the duration
6. Orientation
7. Creation Date
8. Available file formats
9. Ways to access the file

This library also provides a way to return certain groups of photos and to also return a 
section of photos based on start and end parameters.

INSTALL THE URBAN IMAGE MODULE
------------------------------

Per instructions in the "Module Development" (https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/iOS+Module+Development+Guide)
guide in section 0 "Setting Up your Module Environment" you'll need to determine where your Titanium SDK is installed.  
It may be installed in "/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium" or "~/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium".

1. Run 'build.py' this will create a zip file that can then be installed.

2. Copy the newly created zip file to the place where the Titanium SDK is installed.

   cp qs.urbanimage.library-iphone-1.0.zip /Library/Application\ Support/Titanium
   
   --- or if you Titanium SDK is installed in your home directory ---

   cp qs.urbanimage.library-iphone-1.0.zip ~/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium

3. The instructions in the "Testing your Module in a test application" section of the "Module Development" indicate
   that the Titanium compiler will unzip the newly copied module.  That hasn't been my experience.  I have found that
   it is necessary to manually unzip the module.

   cd /Library/Application\ Support/Titanium" or cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium depending up 
   on where the SDK is located.

   unzip qs.urbanimage.library-iphone-1.0.zip.  

   This will install the module into the appropriate directories.

REGISTER THE URBAN IMAGE MODULE
-------------------------------

Register your module with your application by editing `tiapp.xml` and adding your module.
Example:

<modules>
	<module version="0.1">qs.urbanimage.library</module>
</modules>

When you run your project, the compiler will know to automatically compile in your module
dependencies and copy appropriate image assets into the application.

DOCUMENTATION FOR THE URBAN IMAGE MODULE
----------------------------------------

Documentation for this module can be found in documentation/index.md

EXAMPLE CODE
--------------------------
An example application exists in example/app.js that demonstrates the use of the module.  
The example app displays all of the photos from the photo library along with the creation date.
If the photo has location data stored with it then you can click on the photo and it will plot the
photo's location on a map.
